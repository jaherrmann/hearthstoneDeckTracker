[Time Log](TimeLog.md)

### Week 3

Tasks completed:
 * Settled on a project 
 * Created a repository for the project
 * Wrote problem statement
 * Created a wireframe mockup of the web site
 * Created a detailed problem plan
 * Created this document
 
I decided that because of the difficulty that would go along creating an environmental code calculator (depsite 
how much I would like to do one) would be entirely too much work to justify going that route. Instead I decided
to create a hearthstone deck tracker. This should be a fairly challenging project because there are over 400 cards currently available to choose from. This creates a world of deckbuilding possiblities and should be fun to create. I also created the scaffolding for the project and need to start looking into API's so that I don't have to create a database for every card ever printed! (This would be an awful idea an I would never do this.) I also finished all the week 3 stuff ahead of time for a first and am now on the 'lead lap' so to speak. Feels good. 

### Week 4

Tasks completed: 
* Finished all week 4 videos
* Created preliminary DB for project
* Implemented hibernate into project

I'm beginning how this is all going to come together, with the stream of work spread over all classes, my internship, and regualar weekend work. So far I've been able to keep my head above water with the weekly assignments, but only just. The exercises are challenging, but not tedious, so that's a positive. I implemented hibernate into my project and after troubleshooting why the DB was coming up null I found that the properties file was pointing at the wrong database--oops. Thankfully the debugger really helped me track down exactly where the query was failing and made it much, much easier to fix. I still hope to get the scaffolding on my .jsps done before the end of the week.

### Week 5

Tasks completed:
* Finished week 5 assignments
* Implemented one to many hibernate into my project

I implemented this week's hibernate activity into my project and modified my database to reflect that new technology. I also put some serious thought into how I how I want my database to perform and the columns fields and areas that I want it to reflect. 


### Week 6

Tasks completed:
* Almost finished setting up the AWS. Running into a problem with the database being able to connect with the hibernate driver.
* I destroyed my project, and then cloned from an existing version. I consider this a success because the project was in such a sorry condition. 
* Added packages and got my log file working again. 

I spent much of my time this week reviewing my peers' code. I also set up my AWS instance and have the ability to ssh into it. Next steps will include thinking about how the controllers for my classes are going to work and implementing servlets for those classes.
