### Week 3

Tasks completed:
 * Settled on a project 
 * Created a repository for the project
 * Wrote problem statement
 * Created a wireframe mockup of the web site
 * Created a detailed problem plan
 * Created this document
 
I decided that because of the difficulty that would go along creating an environmental code calculator (depsite 
how much I would like to do one) would be entirely too much work to justify going that route. Instead I decided
to create a hearthstone deck tracker. This should be a fairly challenging project because there are over 400 cards currently available to choose from. This creates a world of deckbuilding possiblities and should be fun to create. I also created the scaffolding for the project and need to start looking into API's so that I don't have to create a database for every card ever printed! (This would be an awful idea an I would never do this.) I also finished all the week 3 stuff ahead of time for a first and am now on the 'lead lap' so to speak. Feels good.
